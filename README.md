This project is a fully containerized, production-ready DevOps environment designed to showcase modern infrastructure practices. It combines Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, NGINX, TLS, monitoring, and end-to-end CI/CD to demonstrate how a real-world application is built, deployed, and operated.

## Recruiter TL;DR

This repository demonstrates a production-style DevOps platform including:

- Dockerized microservices (frontend + backend + PostgreSQL)
- Kubernetes deployments with health checks and rolling updates
- CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions
- Security scanning with Trivy
- Monitoring stack with Prometheus and Grafana
- Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
- Self-hosted Kubernetes cluster with Ingress and TLS

The project simulates a real production deployment pipeline from commit to running services.

## ⚙️ What does it do?

The platform builds and deploys a Node.js backend, serves a static frontend through an NGINX gateway, routes traffic with an Ingress Controller, and exposes services securely over TLS. It also includes automated CI/CD pipelines, container image publishing, Kubernetes manifests, and a complete monitoring stack with Prometheus, Grafana (via Helm), and Alertmanager.

## 🔄 CI/CD Overview

The CI/CD setup automates service delivery to Kubernetes and production stack operations.

- Build, test, and validate services
- Publish versioned container images to GHCR
- Apply rolling updates with health verification
- Support production deploy, rollback, and shutdown workflows

![Pipelines](docs/images/deploy-nginx.png)

---

## 🚀 Backend CI

Backend CI validates code quality and build readiness on pushes and pull requests.

- Run dependency installation and build checks
- Validate backend project structure
- Build backend container image for verification

![Backend CI](docs/images/backend-ci.png)

---

## 📦 Continuous Delivery

Delivery pipelines automate image publication and deployment actions.

- Push images to GHCR
- Update deployment image references
- Validate rollout and post-deploy health

---

## 📈 Pipeline Visibility

Track workflow execution with logs and historical runs directly in GitHub Actions.

![Pipelines running](docs/images/backend-cd-working.png)

---

## 📉 Prometheus

Prometheus collects backend metrics in real time and stores time-series data for analysis.

---

## 📊 Grafana

Grafana provides dashboards and visualization for Prometheus data (installed via Helm).

![Grafana metrics](docs/images/metrics-grafana.png)

## 📌 Key Metrics

- Latency ($p50$, $p95$, $p99$)
- Requests per second (RPS)
- Error rates ($5xx$, $4xx$)
- CPU and memory consumption
- Database connectivity status

## 🌍 Environments

The project supports two fully configured environments.

### 🖥️ Development Environment

- Docker Compose for fast local iteration
- Hot reload for frontend/backend changes
- Local PostgreSQL container
- Self-signed certificates

```shell
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

### 🏢 Production Environment

- Kubernetes rolling deployments
- TLS with cert-manager + ACME
- Prometheus + Grafana + Alertmanager monitoring
- Automated CI/CD with GitHub Actions

```shell
kubectl apply -R -f k8s/
```

### 📊 Environment Comparison

| Area | Development | Production |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Orchestration | Docker Compose | Kubernetes |
| Persistence | Local volumes | StatefulSets + PVC |
| TLS/HTTPS | Self-signed | Let's Encrypt |
| Scalability | Manual | Horizontal scaling |

---

## 🧱 Network & Traffic Flow

Traffic enters through MetalLB and NGINX Ingress, then routes to frontend or backend services based on path rules.

- `/api/*` → Backend service (ClusterIP:3000)
- `/*` → Frontend service (ClusterIP:80)

Backend is the only component allowed to access PostgreSQL, providing network-level isolation.

---

## 📎 External Access

### 1) Ingress Controller Service

Ingress exposes ports `80` and `443` to receive external traffic.

### 2) Ingress with External IP

### 3) TLS Validation

### 4) API Request Validation

## 📥 Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/luisrodvilladaorg/wellnes-ops.git
cd wellnes-ops
```

Configure environment variables (based on your `.env` strategy).

Start the development stack:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

Check backend logs:

```bash
docker logs wellness-backend-container
```

---

## ☸️ Kubernetes (Production-style mode)

Apply Kubernetes resources:

```bash
kubectl apply -R -f k8s/
```

For advanced ingress and TLS setup, follow the documentation in `docs/`.
